        testimonial: `<p>Donny was an invaluable front-end developer on the Innovation Hub team, known for his curiosity, teamwork, and hands-on approach. He took initiative where others hesitated, such as volunteering for UiPath training to build automation botsâ€”despite it being outside his role. His "I'll figure it out" mindset made him a standout teammate. He engaged meaningfully in discussions, asked thoughtful questions, and truly invested in the success of both the product and the people around him.
